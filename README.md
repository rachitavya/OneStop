### Problem Statement
- The emergence of online education has transformed the way we learn in all fields of study. With an abundance of resources available for every topic and domain, students can quickly become overwhelmed, leading to distractions and confusion.
- Many students face the challenge of deciding which resources to use, making it difficult to focus and stay on track. Is there a platform that can guide us on where to start and which courses to choose?
- We need a solution that can help students navigate the vast array of resources available, enabling them to focus on what matters most – learning.

### Solution
- Course personalization: We have created a website which fetches best resources from all over the internet. Be it blogs, videos or websites, we've got you covered.
- We track all the activity of a user spent on our website. We use these activities to recommend him more content of that type.
- We have a community module on our website on which you can share your new learnings.
